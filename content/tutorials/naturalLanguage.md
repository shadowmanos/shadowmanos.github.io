Use Java to programmatically analyse the grammar of plain English text
i.e. [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) or programmatically create
text in English i.e. [Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation) or
classify various pieces of text according to some criteria
i.e. [Text Categorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_categorisation).

All text samples used here are Star Trek quotes (in English, not Klingon) sourced from
either [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek)
or [Memory Alpha](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Main). After an entirely unscientific thought process, I
decided such quotes are grammatically correct, adequately diverse and of average complexity.

Won't bore you with grammar or linguistic theory as this is written from a code monkey's rather than a PhD student's
perspective. Think Scotty instead of Spock. There are links to more theory at each page if you absolutely must.

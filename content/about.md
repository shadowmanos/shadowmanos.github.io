Hi

I am a Software Engineer currently based in London, UK. Lived and worked at Stuttgart, Germany and Athens, Greece in the
past.
I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build REST APIs and other forms of software plumbing. I have led small teams on a
number of projects,
and it wasn't a complete disaster. I have worked on advertisement, trading, customer analytics, identity and access
management,
natural language processing, sports stats websites, and PC based computer vision and robot control. I have a Master in
Robotics,
where I performed complex math calculations in C++, before I learned about web servers and databases. Easily bored with
tedious tasks
and like to automate everything. Big fan of lean (management and development) and minimising waste in any form. I aspire
for quality without bureaucracy.
Inspired by one the greats of our
industry [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)#Legacy),
I insist on the term Software Engineer instead of developer, hacker or programmer. Software should be approached with
the same diligence and
rigor as other engineering practices, and practitioners should demand the same respect.

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobbies are playing hard rock (guitar and keys), touring around London on
my vintage steel bicycle, and traveling (29 countries in 2 continents withing 5 years, and then COVID-19 happened).
I regularly quote Star Trek at work settings, and I won't apologise for it.

Hi

I am a Software Engineer currently based in London, UK. Lived and worked at Stuttgart, Germany and Athens, Greece in the
past. I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build REST APIs and other forms of software plumbing. I have led small teams on
a number of projects, and it wasn't a complete disaster. I have worked on exchanges and trading, customer analytics,
identity and access management, natural language processing, sports stats websites, and PC based computer vision and
robot control. I have a Master in Robotics, where I performed complex math calculations in C++, before I learned about
web servers and databases. Easily bored with tedious tasks and like to automate everything. Learned long ago that once
you master the keyboard and the command line, GUIs and mice seem tedious. I aspire for quality without bureaucracy.
Inspired by one the greats of our
industry [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)#Legacy), I insist on the term
Software Engineer instead of developer, hacker or programmer. Software should be approached with the same diligence and
rigor as other engineering practices, and practitioners should demand the same respect.

You can find my [CV here](ManosNikolaidisCV.md) with more boring details.

Aside from application building, I enjoy using Java through a REPL for exploratory and interactive data analysis. I blog
about it [here](https://shadowmanos.github.io/explore-data-with-a-java-repl)

You may also find me at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1413133/manos-nikolaidis)
and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manosnikolaidis).

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobbies are playing hard rock (guitar and keys), touring around London on
my vintage steel bicycle, and traveling (29 countries in 2 continents withing 5 years, and then COVID-19 happened). I
have been caught quoting Star Trek at work settings, and I didn't apologise.

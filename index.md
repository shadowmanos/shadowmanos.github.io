Hi

I am a [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)#Legacy) currently based in London. Lived / worked at Stuttgart Germany and Athens Greece in the past. I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build REST APIs and other forms of software plumbing. I have led small teams on a number of projects and it wasn't a disaster. I have worked on Identity and Access Management systems, Authentication, Natural Language Processing, Sports Websites and PC based robot control. I have a Master in Mechanical Engineering of all things, where I was exposed to advanced math calculations with C++. I am easily bored with tedious tasks and like to automate everything. I haven't fully automated my job yet but getting there. I thrive on Unix OSes, keyboard, command line, agile, DevOps and aspire for quality without bureaucracy.

You can find my [CV here](ManosNikolaidisCV.md) with all the boring details.

I enjoy using Kotlin interactively through its REPL and I blog about it [here](https://shadowmanos.github.io/kotlin-repl-data-cookbook)

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobby is electric guitar and 🤘I cycle everywhere in London regardless of weather.

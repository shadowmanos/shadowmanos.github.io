Hi

I am a [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)#Legacy) currently based in London. Lived and worked at Stuttgart Germany and Athens Greece in the past. I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build REST APIs and other forms of software plumbing. I have led small teams on a number of projects and it wasn't a complete disaster. I have worked on retail customer analytics, identity and access management, authentication, natural language processing, sports websites and PC based robot control. I have a Master in Robotics, where I mostly dealt with advanced math calculations with C++. I am easily bored with tedious tasks and like to automate everything. I thrive on Unix OSes, keyboard, command line, agile and DevOps. I aspire for quality without bureaucracy.

You can find my [CV here](ManosNikolaidisCV.md) with more boring details.

I enjoy using Kotlin and I blog about using the REPL for exploratory and interactive data analysis [here](https://shadowmanos.github.io/explore-data-with-kotlin-repl)

You may also find me at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1413133/manos-nikolaidis), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manosnikolaidis) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadowmanos) though I mostly rant against Brexit at Twitter.

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobbies are playing hard rock on electric guitar, ðŸ¤˜cycling everywhere in London regardless of weather and traveling (33 countries in 3 continents so far)

Hi

I am a Software Engineer currently based in London. Lived and worked at Stuttgart Germany and Athens Greece in the past. I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build REST APIs and other forms of software plumbing. I have led small teams on a number of projects, and it wasn't a complete disaster. I have worked on retail customer analytics, identity and access management, authentication, natural language processing, sports websites and PC based robot control. I have a Master in Robotics, focusing on advanced math calculations with C++. Easily bored with tedious tasks and like to automate everything. I thrive on Unix OSes, keyboard, command line, agile and DevOps. I aspire for quality without bureaucracy. Inspired by one the greats of our industry [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)#Legacy) I insist on the term Software Engineer instead of developer, hacker or programmer. Software should be approached with the same diligence and rigor as other engineering practices and practitioners should demand the same respect.

You can find my [CV here](ManosNikolaidisCV.md) with more boring details.

I enjoy using Kotlin and blog about using the REPL for exploratory and interactive data analysis [here](https://shadowmanos.github.io/explore-data-with-kotlin-repl)

You may also find me at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1413133/manos-nikolaidis), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manosnikolaidis) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadowmanos) though I mostly rant against Brexit at Twitter.

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobbies are playing hard rock on electric guitar, ðŸ¤˜cycling everywhere in London regardless of weather and traveling (25 countries in 2 continents so far)

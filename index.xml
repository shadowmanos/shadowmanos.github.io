I am a Software Engineer currently based in London, UK. Lived and worked at Stuttgart, Germany and Athens, Greece in the past. I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build REST APIs and other forms of software plumbing. I have led small teams on a number of projects, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete disaster. I have worked on advertisement, trading, customer analytics, identity and access management, natural language processing, sports stats websites, and PC based computer vision and robot control.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shadowmanos.github.io/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadowmanos.github.io/cv/</guid><description>Professional Experience VIOOH Ltd Virtual exchange for Out Of Home advertising. London, UK (August 2020 — now)
I maintain and upgrade a service integrating our platform with external APIs, and I am the main point of contact for technical issues. Improved deployment processes of the team’s microservices and migrated them to Java 11. Introduced automated integration tests. Mentored junior developers on development and troubleshooting processes. Technical management of JIRAs e.g. dependencies between them, recommended approach, testing procedure.</description></item><item><title>Explore data with Java</title><link>https://shadowmanos.github.io/exploredatawithjava/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadowmanos.github.io/exploredatawithjava/</guid><description>Here I am documenting for my (and hopefully your) benefit, my attempts to use a Java REPL for retrieving, processing, and recording all sorts of data. I am using Java at work, and it&amp;rsquo;s not worth switching to a whole different ecosystem e.g. Python, or bothering with Intellij/maven/gradle projects for such tasks.
I am using j&amp;rsquo;bang to start a Java REPL, with installation instructions here. With j&amp;rsquo;bang we can use a *.</description></item><item><title>File operations</title><link>https://shadowmanos.github.io/tutorials/processingfiles/fileoperations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadowmanos.github.io/tutorials/processingfiles/fileoperations/</guid><description>Pre-filing We&amp;rsquo;ll see some simple one line examples on operations on files themselves without modifying contents. We&amp;rsquo;ll just use standard Java classes. To run these commands make sure you have installed j&amp;rsquo;bang and then at your terminal do:
jbang -i https://github.com/shadowmanos/explore-data-with-java/blob/master/tutorials/processingFiles/fileOperations.jsh List folders and files First step is always to create a Path that represents a path to a file or folder, and in many ways supersedes the older File class.</description></item><item><title>File Processing</title><link>https://shadowmanos.github.io/tutorials/processingfiles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadowmanos.github.io/tutorials/processingfiles/</guid><description>Use Java to programmatically and interactively manage and modify files and folders.

All text samples used here are Star Trek quotes (in English, not Klingon) sourced from either Wikipedia or Memory Alpha. After an entirely unscientific thought process, I decided such quotes are grammatically correct, adequately diverse and of average complexity.</description></item><item><title>Play with Stanford CoreNLP's Simple API</title><link>https://shadowmanos.github.io/tutorials/naturallanguage/corennlpintro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadowmanos.github.io/tutorials/naturallanguage/corennlpintro/</guid><description>Core what now? CoreNLP is a Natural Language Processing library written in Java by some lovely people at Stanford University and available under a GPL or commercial license. You can build Java applications with it, use it through a REST API from any language or invoke through your OS command line. CoreNLP recently introduced an alternative Simple API which is simple and concise and ideal for a REPL. To run these commands make sure you have installed j&amp;rsquo;bang and then at your terminal do:</description></item></channel></rss>

## Professional Experience

#### [Pulselive Ltd](http://pulselive.com/)
*London, UK (February 2016 – now)*


I work in the backend team building microservices with *Java SE 8*. The main functionality is to record all
events (goals, red cards, substitutions etc) from a feed and provide aggregate stats for teams,
players and competitions. I've been involved in www.premierleague.com and www.worldrugby.org/ also
supporting the pertinent mobile apps. These are high traffic websites and optimizing SQL queries is
important. I have also dealt with push notifications for mobile apps,
secure login in websites and clients for external APIs. I typically deal directly with product
management, creative, front-end and third parties.
Other tech we use includes *Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, thrift, Maven and Linux*. I have dealt with about
half the services provided by *AWS* including container service (*Docker*).


#### Pilotware Ltd
*London, UK (February 2015 – February 2016)*

I designed and developed a service for Natural Language Processing. The input was text in English and
the output an XML document with information extracted from the ext. NLP was based on CoreNLP library
from Stanford and the functionality was quite more advanced than what you might do with regex or sentiment analysis.
To provide the required latency and throughput and allow software updates on running system without downtime,
I came up with an architecture of multiple instances in different servers behind a load balancer and messaging to update
configuration at runtime. I was also tasked with leading a small team around this project including a
front-end engineer and a few research scientists. All services ran at in-house servers and I cooperated
with a dedicated sysadmin for deployment, monitoring etc.
Tech used included *JavaSE 8, CoreNLP, Maven, ActiveMQ, Linux.*


#### [Shadow Robot Company Ltd](https://www.shadowrobot.com)
*London, UK (August 2013 – February 2015)*

I designed and developed software for real-time control of anthropomorphic robots.
That was PC-based control in the sense that a server running *Linux* received (*TCP/IP*) the current position of the robot,
compared with the desired motion it should perform and issued new position commands. This required
sub-millisecond latency which in turn required some Linux black magic like pinning threads to cores,
real-time thread scheduling locking memory before the control loop started and other low-level stuff.
This was implemented in *C++* with *Python* used for some coordination and monitoring tasks without low-latency requirements.

I mostly worked on Shadow's flagship product the [Dexterous Hand](www.shadowrobot.com/products/dexterous-hand)
and secondarily on [RoNeX](https://www.shadowrobot.com/ronex-available-for-pre-order/).
I was involved in the [Moley robot chef](www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32282131) where I wrote the software that
coordinated in real-time (1 KHz rate) the motion of 4 robots (2 hands and 1 arms). I proudly represented
Shadow at [Ros Kong 2014](https://events.osrfoundation.org/ros-kong-2014/) including a lightning talk.
Some of the code I contributed to is open source at Github. E.g. [ros_ethercat](https://github.com/shadow-robot/ros_ethercat)
Tech we used included *ROS, Boost, Eigen, libuv, Pthreads, MongoDB, Linux*

#### [Inos Automationssoftware GmbH](http://www.inos-automation.de/index.php/en/)
*Athens, Greece – Stuttgart, Germany (April 2008 – August 2013)*

I wrote software in *C++* for PC-based, robotic vision applications in the automotive industry.
That was PC-based robot control software running on a server connected (*TCP/IP*) to digital cameras,
other sensors, industrial robotic manipulators and other servers in the factory including databases.
I was mostly involved in the core libraries and the "state machine" that coordinated all other
systems connected to our servers and internal libraries for computer vision. The "state machine"
typically used a thread, a socket and a config file per other system connected.
I regularly travelled from our R&D department at Athens to factories around our sales and support center at Stuttgart.

I was involved among others in the Daimler SMA212 project for quality inspection on doors in assembled
Mercedes E-Class cars. That involved 4 servers and more than 100 cameras. Also spent a lot of time
at the Audi KLT Depalletizing project the KUKA USPS project. Both robots that picked boxes from pallets
at automated warehouses. Our robot vision guidance system processed data from 3D laser scanners and
digital cameras to find the boxes on the pallets. At some point I also wrote copy-protection software
depending on USB dongles.
Tech we used included *Boost, MySQL, Qt, Git, Windows SDK*.


#### Independent Contractor
*Volos, Greece (May 2004 – March 2008)*

I cooperated with various integrators around my home town on industrial machinery projects.
They built a machine in the workshop and installed on a customer's site. I was contracted to write
software for a PC to control and monitor this machine. Software was desktop applications
written in *C++* with frameworks like *Qt*. Apart from communicating with a machine, 2D graphics
had to be displayed in real-time representing object's shape and the cutting tool's path. So at least
2 threads per application.

Projects included a 2D plasma cutter for metal sheets and machine cutting and drilling large steel beams
(girders) as used in metal buildings.


## Education
*MEng [Mechanical Engineering University of Patras](http://www.mead.upatras.gr/lang_en/)*


Selected courses around control systems, statistics, time-series and robotics. Lot's of math problems
solved on computers.

Master thesis : *"Simulation and control of robotic manipulators with elastic links"*. Wrote software
in C++ to implements simulations and control algorithms. Heavy use of linear algebra and 3D transformations.
Due to heavy computations involved and my slow computer, spent a lot of effort manually optimizing and
also used profiled guided optimization as provided by Visual C++.

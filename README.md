Hi

I am a software engineer currently based in London. Stuttgart Germany and Athens Greece in the past.
I use Java, Spring Boot and SQL to build backend services with REST APIs.
I have led small teams on a number of projects.
I have worked on Identity and Access Management systems, Authentication, Natural Language Processing, Sports Websites and PC based robot control.
I have a Master in Mechanical Engineering of all things, where I was exposed to advanced math calculations with C++.
I am easily bored with tedious tasks and like to automate everything.

You can find my [CV here](ManosNikolaidisCV.md) with more boring details.

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobby is electric guitar ðŸ¤˜
I cycle everywhere in London regardless of weather.

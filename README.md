### Manos Nikolaidis
#### Software Engineer

Hi

I am software engineer and I am currently busy building microservices that expose REST APIs and
hide a lot of data juggling in SQL and Java. In the past I've written software for NLP and robotics.
I have a Masters in Mechanical Engineering of all things, where I started doing advanced math in C++.
I am excited about software with low-latency and high performance requirements. I am easily bored
with tedious tasks and like to automate everything.

### Manos Nikolaidis
#### Software Engineer

Hi

I am a software engineer based in London, currently busy building microservices, that expose REST APIs and
hide a lot of data juggling in SQL and Java. In the past, I've written software for NLP and robotics.
I have a Master in Mechanical Engineering of all things, where I was initially exposed to
advanced math calculations with C++. I am excited about software with low-latency and high performance requirements.
I am easily bored with tedious tasks and like to automate everything.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manosnikolaidis/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadowmanos)

Not that I expect anyone to care, but my main hobby is playing music, both electric guitar and keyboard and
I cycle everywhere in London regardless of weather.
